    <h1>AccelCRM Documentation</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Your sales pipeline and customer relationship management platform.</p>

    <p>AccelCRM helps sales teams manage their contacts, companies, deals, and day-to-day activities from a single interface. This documentation covers every feature of the platform and how to use it effectively.</p>

    <h2>Platform Overview</h2>
    <p>AccelCRM is organized into five main sections, accessible from the sidebar navigation:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Dashboard</strong></td>
          <td>At-a-glance metrics: total contacts, companies, pipeline value, and closed-won revenue. Also shows recent open deals and pending activities.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Contacts</strong></td>
          <td>Manage individual people. Each contact has a name, email, phone, job title, associated company, and a status (lead, active, or inactive).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Companies</strong></td>
          <td>Manage organizations. Each company has an industry, website, size classification, revenue range, and a status (prospect, customer, or churned).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Deals</strong></td>
          <td>Track sales opportunities through a six-stage pipeline. Deals have a dollar value, win probability, and are linked to a contact and optionally a company. Viewable as a Kanban board or a list.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Activities</strong></td>
          <td>Log and track calls, emails, meetings, tasks, and notes. Activities can be linked to a contact or deal and marked as completed.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>The left sidebar provides links to all sections. On mobile screens (under 1024px), the sidebar collapses behind a hamburger menu button in the top-left corner. Tap the button to open it, or tap outside to close it.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the sidebar you will find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Back to Demos</strong> &mdash; returns to the demo selection screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Reset Demo</strong> &mdash; restores all data to its original seed state. A confirmation dialog is shown before resetting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <h3>Statuses</h3>
    <p>Both contacts and companies have status fields that indicate where they are in the customer lifecycle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> <span class="badge badge-blue">lead</span> &rarr; <span class="badge badge-green">active</span> &rarr; <span class="badge badge-gray">inactive</span></li>
      <li><strong>Companies:</strong> <span class="badge badge-blue">prospect</span> &rarr; <span class="badge badge-green">customer</span> &rarr; <span class="badge badge-red">churned</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pipeline Value</h3>
    <p>The pipeline value displayed on the dashboard is a <em>weighted</em> total. It is calculated by summing each open deal's value multiplied by its win probability. For example, a $100,000 deal at 50% probability contributes $50,000 to the pipeline value.</p>

    <h3>Data Relationships</h3>
    <p>Entities in AccelCRM are connected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>Contact</strong> can belong to a <strong>Company</strong>.</li>
      <li>A <strong>Deal</strong> is always linked to a <strong>Contact</strong> and optionally to a <strong>Company</strong>.</li>
      <li>An <strong>Activity</strong> can be linked to a <strong>Contact</strong>, a <strong>Deal</strong>, or both.</li>
    </ul>
